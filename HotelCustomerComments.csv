The unit itself was kind of run down -  worn out tub and shower, general 60s feel throughout. After a few minutes of walking around barefoot, the soles of our feet were dirty and so we cleaned the floor with a cloth. The cloth we used became immediately brown from the dirt. The main bed was fine but the sofa bed folded out sloping the frame was bent and so making the mattress sloping downwards. Great location for the room but not much positive other than that.",
